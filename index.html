    <h2 class="Header sub">About me</h2>
        <div class="info"><p>Hello, my name is Alex. I'm 18 years old, and I'm studying programming. First of all, a want to admitt, that i've passed a semester of BSU, historical facultee, but obstacles made me unable to continue studying.
        But you can be interested, why did I made a step into IT? Answer is rather simple and consists of two factors.</p><p>At first, I'm fond of computers. At the age of 8-9 I started working with the computer. But not just working - I was just crazy! 
        I was crazy about reinstalling systems, downloading software, hacking my father's passwords, etc. So, computers is my wave.</p><p>The second reason is following. IT is a perspective area, and I can not only make lots of money, but develop myself, reach new 
        results. And the profession of frontend developer is a perfect choice, i suppose.
            </p>

    <h2 class="Header sub nom2">Languages</h2>
    <div class="info2"><p>And now I'm going to tell you about the languages, I know. Of course, in this situation this word can have two different meanings: languages, we speak, and languages, mashines use. So, I'll tell you about both of them. </p><p>Speaking about "human" languages, I know Russian and Belorussian as native ones. Understand Polish (It can help me to be relocated). In school I was studying English (8 years) and German 
        (2 years). So, you can aprice my english just while reading this text, but about my german i'd better tell you. It's a pity, but I know german only for A1-A2 because of small active vocabulary. Our teacher taught us all the grammar, but now we cannot link even two 
        words. But you can be sure: if Deutsch is nesessary, I can improve it.
